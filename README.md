Marker Clusterer â€“ A Google Maps JavaScript API utility library
==============

A Google Maps JavaScript API v3 library to create and manage per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.

[Reference documentation](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-marker-clusterer/docs/reference.html)

Typescript version, with some additions / improvements.

## Usage

Download or clone `markerclusterer.js` and images `m1.png` to `m5.png`, save images in `images` folder.

To use your own custom cluster images just name your images `m[1-5].png` or set the `imagePath` option to the location and name of your images like this: `imagePath: 'customImages/cat'` for images `cat1.png` to `cat5.png`.

    ...
(require as any)(['konnect/viewmodels/components/konnect/map/js-marker-clusterer/marker-clusterer'], requires => {
      this.MarkerClusterer = requires.MarkerClusterer;

      [...]

      clustererOptions["maxZoomReachedCb"] = (marker) => {
        //Called when max zoom reached and there's still a cluster at the position
        //Do some code
    };

    //Create the MarkerClustere
    new this.MarkerClusterer(this.map, markers, clustererOptions);
});
    ...
